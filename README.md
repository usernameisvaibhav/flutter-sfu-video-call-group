### Description:
- This is sandbox video call application using Flutter and WebRTC.

### SFUs â€“ Selective Forwarding Units

- In this case, each participant still sends just one set of video and audio up to the SFU, like our MCU. However, the SFU doesnâ€™t make any composite streams. Rather, it sends a different stream down for each user. In this example, 4 streams are received by each participant, since there are 5 people in the call.
- The good thing about this is itâ€™s still less work on each participant than a mesh peer-to-peer model. This is because each participant is only establishing one connection (to the SFU) instead of to all other participants to upload their own video/audio. But, it can be more bandwidth intensive than the MCU because the participants each receive multiple streams downloaded.
- The nice thing for participants about receiving separate streams is that they can do whatever they want with them. They are not bound to layout or UI decisions of the MCU. If you have been in a conference call where the conferencing tool allowed you to choose a different layout (ie, which speakerâ€™s video will be most prominent, or how you want to arrange the videos on the screen), then that was using an SFU.
- Media servers which implement an SFU architecture include Jitsi and Janus.

### Quick start

#### Start WebRTC SFUs Server
- Step 1: open **nodejs_sfus_server**
- Step 2: run **yarn** or **npm i** for install packages
- Step 3: run **yarn start** or **npm start** for start server
- Server is running on port 5000, you can change port in **server.js**

#### Mobile Application
- Step 1: run **flutter pub get** for install flutter pub
- Step 2: replace socket url by ip and port your server in **flutter_webrtc_sfus/lib/src/pages/home/home_page.dart**, line **79**
- Step 3: run app and auto connect in call
